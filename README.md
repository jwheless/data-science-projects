# data-science-projects
A repository of all my Data Science Projects I have worked on

This repository contains a number of different data science projects I have completed, with detailed instructions on how to reproduce and interpret the results attained.

Use this repository to learn how to build and interpret:

  -Linear and Multiple Linear Regression models to make predictions
  
  -Logistic Regression models for classification and calculate the probability of an event occuring
  
  -K-means clustering to group data points with similar attributes

This repository will provide you with a strong foundation in Data Science and how to build Machine Learning models using Python programming and popular Python libraries, such as: Pandas, Numpy, Sci-kit Learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. 


Note: These analyses were performed locally in a Jupyter Notebook using Python 3 kernels and uploaded to this repository. The notebooks here are not interactive, but are intended to provide guidance on how to reproduce the same results in your own Jupyter Notebooks or local IDE. If you have never used a Jupyter Notebook, it can be accessed through the Anaconda Navigator by downloading the Anaconda Package (https://www.anaconda.com/download) for your respective OS. All relevant data files used for these analyses are located in the 'Data Files' folder on this repository.
