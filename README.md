# data-science-projects
A repository of all my Data Science Projects I have worked on

This repository contains a number of different data science projects I have completed, with detailed instructions on how to reproduce and interpret the results attained.

Use this repository to learn how to build and interpret:

  -Linear and Multiple Linear Regression models to make predictions
  
  -Logistic Regression models for classification and calculate the probability of an event occuring
  
  -K-means clustering to group data points with similar attributes

This repository will provide you with a strong foundation in Data Science and how to build Machine Learning models using Python programming and popular Python libraries, such as: Pandas, Numpy, Sci-kit Learn, and Matplotlib.
